{.br2}

We study how visual cues such as optic flow or motion of objects are encoded in the brain of larval zebrafish.

![diencephalic nuclei](/img/die-prosomerse_980px.jpg)
{.br2}

We map diencephalic nuclei that process sensory cues for orienting movements and correlate their activity dynamics with neurochemical specificity.
