## Genetic dissection of brain-wide visual function

As a Systems Neuroscience researcher, my work on the project “Genetic Dissection of Brain-wide Visual Function” is a fascinating journey into the intricate workings of the brain. This project aims to understand how the brain processes visual information at a genetic level. We employ a combination of molecular and optical engineering techniques to map out the neural circuits involved in visual processing. By genetically manipulating these circuits, we can observe changes in brain-wide visual function, providing insights into the genetic factors that influence visual perception.

Our approach involves the use of advanced functional imaging techniques to visualize these circuits in action. We also leverage data science methodologies to analyze the vast amounts of data generated from our imaging studies. This allows us to identify patterns and correlations that might not be immediately apparent, helping us to better understand the dynamic nature of neural circuits. Through this project, we hope to uncover the genetic basis of visual function and how it contributes to adaptive behavior.

## Diencephalic achitectures for visual orientation

In the project “Diencephalic Architectures for Visual Orientation”, we delve into the role of the diencephalon, a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in sensory integration and motor control. Our goal is to understand how the architectural structures within the diencephalon contribute to visual orientation, a fundamental aspect of behavior.

We use a combination of molecular techniques and optical engineering to visualize the diencephalic structures and their connections. By observing these structures in action, we can begin to understand how they process visual cues and contribute to orientation behaviors. We also employ data science techniques to analyze our findings, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions from complex datasets. This project represents a significant step towards understanding the neural basis of visual orientation and how it influences adaptive behavior. Through our research, we aim to shed light on the complex interplay between genetics, neural circuitry, and behavior.
